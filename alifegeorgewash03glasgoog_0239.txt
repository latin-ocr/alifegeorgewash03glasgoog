From the Nero-Yovkev.

lv iswith no small satisfaction we announoe to our
readers the appearance of this work; because it cannot
leil to produce the happiest effects upon the rising gener-
ation, when introduced into our schools as a class-book,
which it undoubtedly will be. A lise ol Washington in
Latin is indeed peculiarly appropriate on many accounts.
Whose deeds more worthy of its lofty dictionl Whose
virtues more deserving of its majestic simplicityl What
Roman could boast of a life to pure l—of patriotism so
disinterestedl It is well to placeio the hands of our
youth this record os the Father of his country, in the
same langnagc in which they read of the valour of Caesar,
os the prudence of Fabius, and the virtues of Cincinna-
tus; sor it will enable them, with a glow of honest pride,
to leel that in Waslrington all these rare and exalted at-
tributes were combined. Nor will it be less gratifying ,

to them to know, that in the wilds of Oluoa “ (Μεθ’ has
been found to hold up to the world an imperishable image
of him who hasbeen emphatically and truly pronounced

to be the “ first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts

ef his countrymen.”
Os its Latinity and style tt would ill become ιιι to speak,
since sufficient proof accompanies the work, ιιι the certifi- ’

cates annexed to it, of many ol our professore, who bear
ample testimony to its purity, its beauty, and its force.

From tlte Nero-Yorlt Times.

Ture, it it be not the best, is the most extraordinary
book of the day. Asa specimen of pure Latinity, it has
been pronounced by the best scholare in the country to
be a singularly correct and beautiful production. lt
comes before the public in a manner which should com-
mend it to its ltindest attention; and if, as we have every
reason to believe, it is a specimen of Latinity as pure as
it is unconrmon, there can be rto doubt that it will be gen-
erally adopted by our schools and seminaries of learning.
We shall again allude to this extraordinery production; .
and in the meantime we commend it to the attention ol
the scholare os our country.
