resrruouiius. 243

From tlte Soutbero Literory Messenger sor Dec, 1835.

Wr may truly say that not for years have we taken up
ι volume with which we have been so highly gratified‚ as
with the one now before us. Α Life of Washington,
succinet in form, yet in matter sufficiently comprehensive,
has been long e desideratum: but a Life of Washington,
precisely such as e compendious life of that great man
should be-written bya citizen of Ohio-and written, too,

, in Latin, which is not one jot inferior to the Latinos

Erasmus, is, to say the least of it, a novelty.

s We consess that we regarded the first announcement
of this rara ovis with an evil and suspicions eye. 'I'he
thing was· improbable, we thought. Mt. Reynolds was
’ quizzing us-the brothers Herper were hoaxed—and
Messieurs Anthou and Co. were mistaken. lt all events,
we had made up our minds to be especially severe upon
Mr. Glass, and to put no saith in that species of classical
Latin which should emanate from the backwoods of Ohio.
We now solemnly make arecantation of our preconceived
opinions, and so proceed immediately to do penance for

our unbelief.
Mr. Reynolde is antltled to the thanks of his couuny-

men sor his instrumentality in bringing this bnolr before
the public. 1t has already done wonders in the cause of
the classics; and we are false prophete 11 it do not ulti-
mately prove the means of stirring up to a new life and
aregenerated energy that love of the learned tongues
which is the surest protection of our own vernaculae lpu-
guage from impurity, but which, wc ere grieved to see, ie
in a languishing and dying condition in the land.

We have read Mr. R.'s preface with great attention;
and meeting with it, as we hamdene, among a multipli-
city ο1 worldly concerno and everyday matters and oc-
currerem, it will long remain impressed upon our minda
es an episode of the purest romanoe. We have no diffi-
culty in entering fully with Mr. Reynolds into his kindly
ieelings towards Mr. Glass. We perceive at once that
we could have loved and reverenced the man. His im-
age ir engravan upon our fancy. lndeed, wa behold him
