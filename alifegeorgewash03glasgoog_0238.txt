est patriot and the purest conqueror, that ever leda host
ιο glory, or sheathed the sword in honourable selfdeny-
ing peace.

It should be indeed a source of honest and patriotic
exultation ιο every trnebcrn American, ιο think that, by
the zeelous exertions of an obscure, an humble, and un-
known indi'vidual‚ the fame of his country’s hrightest
ornament may lie spread from one* extremity cf the
civilized world ιο the other: that it may do so iecur
eernest wish; and, as a first step towards this end, we
strenuously advice its immediate adoption as a class·
book in all our district schoole‚ and should further be in-
clined to advocate 'its admission into the higher institu-
tions fcr the disseminatiou of learning. In recommend-
ing this work so strongly to the public, and especially ιο
the instructore· and guardians of youth, we are fully
burne out by the strongly-expressed opinions, ιο the same
effect as curs, cf the best and ripert scholare of our
ccunuy, which will be found appended ιο the text.

From tlte Nero-Yorlr American.

A circ of Weshington, written in pure, flowing, easy.
and classical Latin, by a country sclioulmaster in Ohio,
'whose life was passed in teaching the children of his
country neighbours ιο read and write, is certainly a re
markable productiori. The circumstances under which s
it was composed, together with the manner in which the
editor, Mr. Reynolds, became acquainted with the author,
are told in ernost interesting mannerin Mr. R.'s preface,
from which we make no apology for extracting largely.

The interest of this story may justly add to that of the
work it ushers forth; and when it is said that Professor
Anthou of Columbia College, Professor Petton of the
New·York University, Professor Wylie of the University
of Pennsylvania, and other approved scholare, bear wit·
nese to the purity of the style in which it is written, itis
not en unreascnable hope ιο express, that this life cf
Washington may become an elementary class-book in our
Latin schools.
