less individual, whom a sound and liberal educa
tion had fitted for higher pursuits, but whom mir·

ful intluenoe that classical studies, when properly
pursued, are calculated to exercise over the mind ; ‘
how they eling to it, even amid missenum, and
impart a sure soloce under all the ills of life.
