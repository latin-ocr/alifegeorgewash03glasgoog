Ma. Reruoune,
¹ Deae S1e‚—In compliance with your requeetl heve
examined “A Life of Waehington, in Latin Proae, by
Frencie Glass, A. M„ of Ohio.” My opiniones thie per-
formence ia, that iu purity of style, rotundity oi period,

‘end judicioue selection of worda, itis exceeded by none Α

of the modern worke introductory to the atudy of the
ancient Roman classice. Ite imperfectione are few; ite
beauties numerous. It will be a valuable acquisition to
our classical echoola, initiatory to Ceeear or Nepos, or
euch first Roman author ee the toacher may see cauea to
adopt. Such en American book hae hitherto been ede·
sideretum. It ie now furniehed. It ie well calculated
to fire the youthful genius, and inspire the generoue mind
with the purest patriotic sentimenta.

In thus expreseing myreis, I cannot help mingling
acme feeling with my recollectione of the author. Iwee
acquainted with Mr. Gleee from hie boyieh days. He
was en enthusiaetic votery os the classic muse immedi-
ately on his initiation into the Grammar School. 'lhet
he laboured not in vein, thie productiori will be a leeting
memorial.

Very respectfully, youra‚ dcc,

S. Β. WYLIE.
