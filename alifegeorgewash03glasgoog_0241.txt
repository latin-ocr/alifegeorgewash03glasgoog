A word or two respecting the Latinity 01 110 book.
We sincerely think that it has been underrated. While
we agree with Mr. Reynolds‚ 101 whose opinions, 000-
emlly, we haue 0 high respect, that the work can 10001
01 0000 01 11000 010000000 01 diction, no rich display
01 11000 10001100 and graces which adorn the peges 01
00100 modern Latinists, we think he has iorgotten, in his
