the intervals of hia toilsome life, have still nourished his
desply-rooted lova of classic lore, still brooded over
bright aspiratione after future glory, till he could imagine
himself about to share insutum ages the fame of the
great Washington as bis biographer and panegyrist; that
he should actually have found leisure to commence and
