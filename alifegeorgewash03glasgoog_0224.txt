Ῑ aava examined with some attention the sheets of a
Life of Washington, in Latin, by Francis Glass, Ass M„
audI consider the work a personnance οἱ no small merit.
ln regard to the style os composition, the writer has suc-
ceeded sar beyond the ordinary efforts at writing in Latin.
The idiom is remarkably pure, the words being selected
with careful attention to precision and classic use. The
barbarismo which the introduction of modern institutione
and observances, particularly the science of war, 3ηά
legislation, must necessarily compel the writer to use,
ere so skilsully reduced to the forms of Roman declen-
sion, that they are not, in general, offensive. Many of
them are words exceedingly sonorous and descriptiva.
Another difficulty os no small hnportance in writing Lat·

in is, the proper use os ‘⁶ equivalents,'’ arising from the
circumstance, that of the numerous classes os words
which our language has borrowed srorn that, the greater
portiones them have now a meaning different from the
origina13 and the use of these words in the same sense

which is annexed to the analogous English terms, would
be a barbarous perversion os their meaning, offensive to
purity and good taste. In avoiding these, the writer of
this work shows accurate and faithful training. But he
has not merely freedom srom faults; he possesses posi-
tive excellences. In his periods‚ he has generally the
flow and gracelul variety which are the principal charm
of the style os history, exhibiting much of ancient digni·
ty and simplicity, and occasionally turning thern with un-
common elegance. In description he is not deficient in
strength and energy, but is easy, and sufficiently diffuse
to avoid the meagemess os a mere annalist. The lise os
the venerated Father of our Country, a character so full
of moral and intellectual grandem, can be delineated in
no so appropriate diction as in the severe and majestio
simplicity os the Roman. And the youthful student of
classic enthusiasm will find the history οἱ his beloved
country invested with acharming interest, when he meets
