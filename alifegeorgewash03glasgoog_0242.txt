we ara mistalren if the sarna can be said of the “ equiv-
alcnts” of Erasmus—certainly not of those used by Gro-
tius, or Addison‚ or Schroeckh, or Buchanan‚ neither of
whom is scrupulous in introducing words from which a
modern ona is deduced, in tha exact sense of tha Eng-
lish analogous term, although that terni may have been

granth perverted from its ‹giginal meaning.
