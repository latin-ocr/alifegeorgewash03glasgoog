nised as not Athenian, by the orer-striotness oi their sote
Greek, by the stiff precision, the ornate redundancy„and

the servile imitation of ancient models. Not content .

with being well acquainted with the lunguage, the com·
posers of scholastic Latin bave for the most part applied
themselves to copy word sor word, and sentence for ten-
tence, the style of this or that Roman author. Every
phrase was modelled upon tho thaps of tbe phrase oe·
cupying a similar position in the work of Livy or Tacitus,
Sallust or Cicero; so that the entire work, bas been
rather a cento of some old author, a thing of sbreds and
patches, thanen original composition,

Widely different from this is the Life of Washington,
by Francis Glass'—-he has written with a full mind, with
a soul fraught of old with the treasures of Roman lore,
not writing his Latin sentences accurately because any
one bad so written his sentences before bim; but because
the style of thedoad languagc flowed as fraely and in aa
pure a stream from his garnished spirit, as would bis
periods in the vernacular. Itis this which givos, its
great charm to his curicus werlu not that it is merely cor-
rect, but that it is naturally so: not that the English
idionis are elegantly transferred into another tongue, but
⁸ that the writer actually thought in Latin. This it is
which rendere it the only modern Latin composition
worthy to be set as a school-book before leamers—that
whatever they learn theroirorn will be as just and pure
asthough it had been drawn fresh from tho lountaitt·
head. This it is which gives us hope, that, written as it
is in the universal tangue, the one language current among ·
the scientific and the polished from Buenos Ayres to Ice-
land, from the islanda of the Paciiic to the shores of tlte
Atlantio‚ it may becomeatextbook andastanding history
in other heunspheres--thst it may be studied by mysti-
ciaing metaphysical Germane in Gottingen or Leipsic;
that it may be mused over by the Spanisb Creole of
Mexico or Paraguay3 that it may inspira the hyperboreae
Russ with the ardent love of liberty, and teach to the
volatile Gaul stability and firmness, by the noble example

ot the most equable and wmuntmnded matr, tbe firm·
