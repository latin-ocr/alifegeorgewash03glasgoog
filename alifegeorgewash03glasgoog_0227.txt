Mn. Rernonne,

Sin ,-ikocept my thanke sor the copy of‘ ‘the Iuse os
Georgo Weshington,¹ in Latin prose.'¹ Iam much pleae-
ed with both the plan and the executiones the work
While our youth ere called upon, in many metaneae, to
study elementary books in our primary eohoole, composed
confessedly by modern scholare, on subjecte of compar-
atively minor importance, why should they not be fur-
niehed with elementary books for their earlier course,
adopted to furnieh a knowledge os our own history, end
especially of the lise oi one whom Amorion, end 1 may
sey aleo Europe, is proud to honour.

With my beet wiehee for your success in endeavouring
to introduoe the work into our primery schoole, . ι

Ι em, deor eir, yours‚&o.
