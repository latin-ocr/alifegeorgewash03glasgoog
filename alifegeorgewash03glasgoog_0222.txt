Ar the request ol Mr. Reynolde, Ι have examined the
manuscript oi a Latin Biography ol Waehington‚ by the
late hdr. Glase, of Ohio, and consider it well worthy ol
publication. It is, indeed, quite acuriosity oi its kind.
Tharais generally en air ol stiffnees in the productione
of modern Latinists, which soon betrays a want ol la'·
miliarity‚ on the part of the writer, with the idiom ern·
ployed by him. Nothing ol this nature is to be discov-
ered in the present work; on the contrary, the most cur-
eory reader cannot fail to be struck with the easy dow
ol the style, end the gracelul turn os very many oi the peri-
ods. The care, too, which has been erercteed in the ee-
lection of appropriate terme and phrases is worthy ol
notice, especially when taken in connexion with the fact
oi the audior’s having written his work without the aid
os any books ol reference, and his having been compel-
led‚ consequently‚ to rely solely on the stores oi hie own
memory. 1 would not wieh to be understood as viewing
this productiori in the light ol en accurately critical and
finished piece, but yet I cannot help thinking that it will
make every good school-book. For the subject will in-
terest the young scholar, and awaken thebert ieelings in
his bosom; while, is the Latinity os the work should at
any time appear to the instructer ol a questionable ur er-
roneous character, he can consult the improvement οἱ
his pupils, and at the same time display his own acumen,

in suggesting other aud better expressione.
